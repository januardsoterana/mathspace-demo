              Challenge starts, and another test the week after the Challenge
              ends. Weâ€™ll generate each of the reports after your students
              complete the test. You can book a 1:1 session with our in-house
              teachers to analyze your data, and measure the growth of your
              students during the Challenge!

              A: The winning schools will be the ones with the highest number of
              average points earned per student. This is calculated by dividing
              the total number of points earned by a school, by the number of
              active students in the school. Read more about this in the

              For instance, if a school signs up with 200 students for the

              of points earned by the school over the Challenge period, divided
              by 200 students. Your school must have a minimum of 50 students
              with active Mathspace accounts to be eligible to participate in
              the Challenge.
