            We mapped all standard outcomes into a knowledge-graph, along with
            all associated pre-requisites, and have created diagnostic questions
            tailored to outcomes. Using an adaptive algorithm - based on Item
            Response Theory, and powered by our proprietary machine learning
            engine - we then select the best outcomes to assess at each
            check-in, based on the information we have for that student.

          <div className="accordion__content">
            For the past 12 months, we have refined the models for a reasonably
            accurate diagnostic assessment from a cold start. But with machine
            learning, the more data we have, the smarter the models get. As
            such, weâ€™ve been running trials with schools since mid-2020 and
            further tuning the algorithms based on their feedback. Our
            pre-launch event will result in additional fine tuning as we gather
            more data and insights from early users.
